#This is a readme file on how to execute the dc, icc and pt scripts.
#It can also use STA to analyze the critical path in the design. 
#prerequisite: change the name in the 'dname'; 
dc: dc_shell -f dc_flopoco.tcl -output_log_file dc.log -topographical_mode
icc: icc_shell -f icc_flopoco.tcl -output_log_file icc.log
pt: pt_shell -file pt_hvt_scaling.tcl -output_log_file pt.log
STA: pt_shell -file STA.tcl -output_log_file STA.log
critical_path: critical_path.tcl; cannot be executed but providing enough commands.
#post-check: timing report to see whether there are violations or failed design.
